    <h1>Capstone Project Proposal</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Topic & Target Audience</h2>
        <p>For the capstone project, I want to explore the topic of menstruation, particularly on the idea of menstrual shame and menstrual moaning, which means the negative conversations between women about their menstruation. I want to build a project that showcases three or more different personas that discuss about their experience and feelings with mensturation. The personas represent people who menstruate from different time periods: past, present, and future. My primary target audience would be people who menstruate.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Lenses</h2>
        <p>My topic would rely on the following lenses discussed in class: speculative design, challenging mental models, data visualization, utopian/dystopian narratives. The lense that my topic will rely on the most is challenging mental models of menstrual shame and menstrual moaning.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>Some potential features that I would include in the project: scroll animation, typewriter effect, keyframe animation on the characters.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Tangents & Challenges</h2>
        <p>Some potential tangents include going towards an educational path or an advocating platform. Some possibilities include discussing hygiene, product, and healthcare. A challenge that I imagine is to combine these factors into my main idea of presenting personas from different time periods.</p>
