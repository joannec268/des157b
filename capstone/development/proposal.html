    <h1>Capstone Project Proposal</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Topic & Target Audience</h2>
        <p>For the capstone project, I want to explore the topic of menstruation, particularly on normalizing menstruation to minimize the negativity and shame revolving this topic. I want to build an interactive map that serves as the visualization of stories relevant to menstruation from different parts of the world. My primary target audience would be people who menstruate.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Lenses</h2>
        <p>My topic would rely on all the lenses discussed in class: speculative design, challenging mental models, data visualization, utopian narratives. The lense that my topic will rely on the most is challenging mental models of menstrual shame and menstrual moaning, which means the negative conversations between women about their menstruation.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>Some potential features that I would include in the project: an interactive map, user input, zoom-in-out animations</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Tangents & Challenges</h2>
        <p>Some potential tangents include going towards an educational path or an advocating platform. A challenge that I imagine is to combine these factors into my main idea of using an interactive map as a basis for people to share stories.</p>
