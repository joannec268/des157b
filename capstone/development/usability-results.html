    <h1>Usability Testing Results</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Significant Observations</h2>
        <p>1. The user was confused about the function of the "try again" button. They thought that it was going to restart the whole page rather than only the quiz section.</p>
        <p>2. The user was confused when the interview question appeared again after clicking the "go to future" button. They thought that the story restarted because the same question existed in the very beginning.</p>
        <p>3. The user struggled with reading the textboxes because sometimes the textboxes were scrolled away too quickly by accident.</p>

        <h2>Other Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Clarify wording for the "try again" button.</li>
            <li>Remove the repeated question to avoid redundancy.</li>
            <li>Improve engagement for the storytelling.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The user experienced minimal confusion when navigating and interacting with my project. The only confused areas were the repeated question and the "try again" button.</p>
        <p>The user liked my project idea for menstrual health advocacy. However, she did not read all the textboxes that told the story. Therefore, I need to make the process of reading more engaging to keep the user's attention.</p>
        <p>To make my project stronger, I might add a typewriter effect to the transition sections and the textboxes to engage the user when reading. To better portray the different time period of each scene, I want to experiment with adding landscape elements that animate while scrolling. I also plan to explore animations from GSAP that I can apply to my project's animation on scroll.</p>
