            <p class="manga-box" data-aos="fade-up">Folks thought our blood could kill crops or make mirrors go dull.</p>
            <p class="manga-box" data-aos="fade-up">Some even believed we could curse someone just by looking at them during our time.</p>
            <p class="manga-box" data-aos="fade-up">To stop the bleeding, we tried all sorts of odd things — like strapping dried toads around their waists or using old rags.</p>
