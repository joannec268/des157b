        <h2>Typewriter on Scroll</h2>
        <p>I want the dialog to begin when the user reaches to a specific point to create a more interactive and engaging storytelling experience. I plan to use the Intersection Observer API to detect when the user scrolls to a specific point on the page. Once the target element enters the viewport, it will trigger the typewriter animation for the dialog text. I am still in the process of leanring and exploring this method.</p>

        <h2>Animation on Scroll</h2>
        <p>I plan to use the <a href="https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/">AOS library</a> to create animation on the textboxes and some graphical elements. I have experimented with this library before and it was fun and intuitive to use. </p>

        <h2>Graphical Animation</h2>
        <p>As the user scrolls down the page, there will be changes in the graphics such as the change in the character's facial expressions. I plan to use the scroll position and an if statement to display the appropriate graphics by conditions. I still need to experiment with this method to see if it will create smooth transitions.</p>

        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <p>To improve usability, I want to implement a timeline that serves as the navigation bar, where the user is able to jump to each section at anytime. Creating a navigation is simple, but I might want it to look more like a timeline/progress bar, which I need to experiment with more.</p>
