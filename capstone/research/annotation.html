            <strong>1.</strong> McHugh, Maureen C. <strong>“Menstrual Shame: Exploring the Role of ‘Menstrual Moaning.’”</strong><em>The Palgrave Handbook of Critical Menstruation Studies [Internet].</em>, U.S. National Library of Medicine, 25 July 2020, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK565666/">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK565666/.</a>
        </p>
        <p class="indent-paragraph">This source analyzes the topic of menstural moaning, which refers to the negative conversations about menstruation between people who menstruate. McHugh discusses how menstural moaning reinforce patriarchal and stigmatizing views of menstruation. McHugh concludes that overcoming menstrual shame requires resisting cultural taboos and challenging societal norms to normalize menstruation and to make the topic more positive.</p>
        <p class="indent-paragraph">This source is highly relevant to my topic for the capstone project as it opens views for me about how menstrual shame is formed – societal norms, cultural taboos, medicalization, desire for connection, etc. This inspires me to explore different approaches when designing, in terms of interaction methods, narrative tones, etc.</p>

        <p class="indent-paragraph">This article explores the evolution of menstrual management from the past to today. The early methods include rudimentary pads made with leather and linen-wrapped moss and sand. In the Middle Ages, periods were viewed with superstition and shame – such as the idea that blood harms crops – leading to bizarre methods like wearing toad powder around the waist. The Modern Age (15th-19th century) introduced menstrual belts, but hygiene remained poor. The 20th century shifted by commercializing hygiene products including Kotex and Tampax. Baker concludes that menstrual hygiene and beliefs have evolved and improved over time as products such as menstrual cups and period underwear improved comfort and hygiene for their users.

        <p class="indent-paragraph">This article contributes to my capstone project because it shows improvement about menstruation and hygiene products over time, which makes it predictable that the future could have better solutions.</p>

        <p class="indent-paragraph">This article discusses the survey conducted by the International Women’s Health Coalition, in partnership with menstrual health app Clue, with nearly 90,000 women from 190 countries. This survey found many euphemisms to avoid directly using the term ‘period’ or ‘menstruation’ when women discuss the topic. This survey also found that only 31% of American women were comfortable speaking to a male family member about their period. The author of the article, Lily Puckett, concludes that such euphemisms and escape from reality shape the laws, medical practice, and shame on women and revolving menstruation.
        </p>
        <p class="indent-paragraph">This article contributes to my capstone project by highlighting the role of euphemism in shaping and reflecting societal attitudes toward menstruation, which I can incorporate into the storytelling aspect of my project.</p>
